CC Bank Statement Reader (only valid for Singapore DBS Bank)
---------------------------
Q: i want to use but i don't know python or coding at all :(

A: install anaconda3, make sure to click the 'set up environment PATH'. after everything done, open Anaconda Prompt and write;
> pip install pdfplumber

now continue with:
> python "C:\Users\yourname\cc_statement_reader.py"

the file path above depends on where your file is downloaded!
and then you can follow the instructions
your statement should be converted to .csv and stored in the same folder where your statement.pdf is

don't hesitate to contact me or raise a request if you find any error (sum error, code not running, etc) c:
